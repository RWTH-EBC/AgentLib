# How does the AgentLib work internally?

The basic idea behind this framework is the usage of digital agents to manage various tasks.
The implementation is motivated by the distributed control of building energy systems.
However, the implementation is carried out to enable a broad usage of the library, e.g. for digital twins, agent based modeling or other forms of cooperative system operation.

In order to understand how the AgentLib functions, you need to understand the setup of an agent:
1. Each agent has multiple **Modules**. In turn, each module exists to fulfill a task: Communication, optimization, predictive maintenance, simulation, etc. This way, an agent may accomplish one or multiple tasks / services.
2. Each agent has exactly one **DataBroker**. This DataBroker manages the communication between Modules of an agent. Is informed of the change of state in other modules and synchronized. Additionally, if one module sets a variable, callbacks in other modules may be triggered, allowing for asynchronous execution of tasks and reactive behaviour.
3. Each agent is located in exactly one **Environment** which specifies the time and handles all processes. Setting the configuration of this environment allows the agent to execute its tasks in realtime, scaled realtime, or as fast as possible in a simulation setting.

Lastly, the whole AgentLib is configurable by json. This means **all** *functional classes* (e.g. `Environment`, `Agent`) contain a respective *configuration class*. All configuration is accomplished using `pydantic`'s `BaseModel`.
This has two implications for users of the AgentLib:
1. If you are a user, you just have to learn how to configure existing code using json.
2. If you want to develop new modules/services, you have to understand the code behind the AgentLib.
At the current stage of development, nearly all new users will have to develop some kind of new module. This is due to the fact that application and modeling in general depends on the goal of your task. However, you may use pre-defined modules such as communicators or predictive controllers. Ready-to-use modules will be contiunally released as plugins for the AgentLib.

All mentioned features are summarized by this general agent Figure:

**Note:** Why did we include the docker symbol? 
Because the AgentLib is fully compatible with [cloneMAP](https://www.fein-aachen.org/projects/clonemap/). 
This way, you can execute any number of agents in different docker containers and machines. 
Thus, the AgentLib is easily executable in a fully distributed way.

There are three key components to any agent: **Modules**, **DataBroker** and the **Environment**.
The following sections describe in brief what the role of each type is.

**Note:** For our use-case, we added the option to model time-variant systems using the `Model` class. However, to understand the AgentLib the understanding of models is not required.

## Modules

As all intelligence of agents is outsourced to the modules of the agent, understanding how modules work is key to using the AgentLib.

As stated in the beginning, classes in the AgentLib are separated by function and configuration, so is the **module**.

### Module configuration: `BaseModuleConfig`

Each module has, besides a `module_id` and an `agent_id` to uniquely identify itself,
other properties defined in its implementation. Some of these will be `AgentVariables`,
or lists of `AgentVariables`, which define the variables that govern how the module 
interacts within the multi-agent-system. Commonly, these variables will be either 
inputs from other agents or modules, and outputs which should be communicated to 
other agents or modules.
All variables specified will be merged into the `variables` field of the Configuration.

Besides these lists, a module configuration can contain any information you need for the function of the module to work.
To add custom information, just extend the `BaseModuleConfig` and add any Field you need.
By extending the class you guarantee that the configuration is correctly parsed at initialization. 
If a user gives wrong inputs, `pydantic` will raise a `ValidationError`.
Without `pydantic`, you would only see the wrong configuration at run-time, possible hours after starting the agent.
This would make debugging and robustness of the agent much more difficult.

### Module function: `BaseModule`

The basic module has no function in itself. To implement your functionality, custom modules need to overwrite to methods:
- `process`: Define any **synchronous** tasks of your module. More on the process in the **Environment** section.
- `register_callbacks`: Define any **asynchronous** task of your module. This function is triggered at initialization of the module and registers any callback you want. More on callbacks in the **DataBroker** section.

To know when to use which method, ask yourself the question: 
**When do I want to excecute a specific taks?**
- If the answer is: **Every X seconds**, use the `process`.
- If the answer is: **Every time a specific variable changes**, use the `register_callback`.

The `BaseModule` already implements some functions everyone uses.
For example, each variable specified in the config will register a callback in the `DataBroker` of the agent.
Thus, each time a matching variable is sent to the `DataBroker`, it's value is directly updated in the Module.
Therefore, you can use the `set` and `get` functions of the `Module` to access any variable you specified in the config via the `name` of the variable.
But what are `variables`? More on that in the next section.

### Variables

All agents use `AgentVariables` to exchange information between modules or agents.
An `AgentVariable` is specified by a number of attributes.
The most important ones are:
- name: Name of the variable. The only required field. Only for agent-internal tasks.
- value: The current value of the variable.
- alias: The publicly known name of the variable. 
  If the name inside an agent is cryptic, e.g. `House.Room.Temp_outdoorAir`, the alias helps to define a common naming space for inter-agent communication, e.g. `T_oda`.
- source: The source of the variable. 
  It is an instance of `Source` and contains either only the `agent_id` or a `module_id`.
  Relevant for the case if multiple agents using the same alias. 
  This way you can specify: I want the variable with alias `T_oda` of agent `RoomAgent`.
- shared: A boolean value, specifying if the variable should be communicated 
  outside the agent.

Aside from that, there are fields of minor importance such as `description`, `unit`, `type`, `ub`, etc.

Variables are stored in each module. To send variables to other modules and agents, use the `send_variable` function in the `DataBroker`.

## DataBroker

The `DataBroker` itself has no configuration, hence only a functional class is present.

### Callbacks

All callbacks in the data_broker are `BrokerCallback` objects. 
Callbacks can be triggered every time the data_broker receives a new variable.
If the fields in `BrokerCallback` match those of the `AgentVariable`, the callback is triggerd / the function is called. 
The callback-function itself is to be defined by the user. 
Any additional arguments provided to the `BrokerCallback` will be passed to the called function in each trigger.

#### How can I add callbacks?

Inside a custom module, one can register a `BrokerCallback` using `self.agent.data_broker.register_callback()`.
This function and a `BrokerCallback` contain the following fields:
- alias: The alias of the `AgentVariable`, i.e. the publicly known name
- source: The `Source` object of the `AgentVariable`. The source contains an `agent_id` and possibly a `module_id`. 
- callback: The callback-function to trigger. 
  Each callback function has one argument, the variable that triggers the callback.
  
If and only if `alias`, `source` and `causality` are matching, the callback is triggered.
If one of the fields is not specified, it is not required to match.

#### Why do I need callbacks?

Callbacks are useful for whenever you want to execute a tasks when the data_broker receives a new variable.
An example would be an MQTT-Communicator. 
Every time an `AgentVariable` is added to the data_broker, the modules callback `send_output` is triggered and publishes the `AgentOuput` to an MQTT-broker.

#### Further examples

To show how different callbacks may be realized, the following short example should clear things up.

```python
from agentlib.core import RTDataBroker, AgentVariable, Source
import time

data_broker = RTDataBroker()


def print_all_callback(variable):
    print("Each variable", variable.name, variable.source)


def print_only_T_oda(variable):
    print("T_oda", variable.name, variable.source)


def print_only_T_oda_of_room_agent(variable):
    print("T_oda of agent RoomAgent", variable.name, variable.source)



data_broker.register_callback(callback=print_all_callback)
data_broker.register_callback(alias="T_oda",
                        callback=print_only_T_oda)
data_broker.register_callback(alias="T_oda",
                        source=Source(agent_id="RoomAgent"),
                        callback=print_only_T_oda_of_room_agent)

data_broker.send_variable(AgentVariable(name="T_oda"))
time.sleep(0.01)
print("################Setting new variable##################")
data_broker.send_variable(AgentVariable(name="T_oda_2"))
time.sleep(0.01)
print("################Setting new variable##################")
data_broker.send_variable(AgentVariable(name="T_oda"))
time.sleep(0.01)
print("################Setting new variable##################")
data_broker.send_variable(AgentVariable(name="T_oda_2", alias="T_oda", source="RoomAgent"))
time.sleep(0.01)
```
Expected output:
```
Each variable T_oda None_None
T_oda T_oda None_None
################Setting new variable##################
Each variable T_oda_2 None_None
################Setting new variable##################
Each variable T_oda None_None
T_oda T_oda None_None
################Setting new variable##################
Each variable T_oda_2 RoomAgent_None
T_oda T_oda_2 RoomAgent_None
T_oda of agent RoomAgent T_oda_2 RoomAgent_None
```

Why did we use the `time.sleep` call? 
Well, because our callbacks are threaded in this example. 
To ensure a deterministic output, we have to give the thread some time to run all callbacks.
But don't worry! Internally, we use the `RTDataBroker` for real time simulations, and the `LocalDataBroker` for local simulation (as fast as possible). 
Thus, you don't have to worry about such things when writing your own module. Only if you start using `Threads`, be sure to check how we solved this issue for the `DataBroker`.

## Environment

The environment is based on `simpy` and exists for two reasons:
1. Depending on realtime (e.g. the `time` module) is not applicable for simulations. 
   `simpy` offers to simulate in real-time or as-fast-as-possible. 
   For real-time, the time of the environment is added to the unix time (`time.time()`) at simulation start. 
   Without real-time, the simulation time is just a float.
2. Different modules in the agent need to be orchestrated. 
   The `process` method, first described in the **Modules** section, enables this orchestration.
   
This following example demonstrates the usage of the `Environment`:

```python
# Import the Environment
from agentlib.core import Environment


def my_first_process(env):
    """Define a dummy process. It uses env.timeout to tell simpy how long a step takes."""
    while True:
        print("Doing first task at time:", env.time)
        yield env.timeout(1)


def my_second_process(env):
    """Define a second dummy process."""
    while True:
        print("Doing second task at time:", env.time)
        yield env.timeout(2)


def simulate(config):
    """Just a small function to prevent duplicate code"""
    env = Environment(config=config)
    # You can add as many custom processes as you wish
    env.process(my_first_process(env))
    env.process(my_second_process(env))
    # Agent normally run forever (unit=None).
    # If you want to simulate for shorter period
    # (here 4 seconds), specify it using `until`
    env.run(until=4)


# Run the simulation
print("################As fast as possible################")
simulate(config={"rt": False})
print("################10 times faster than real time################")
simulate(config={"rt": True, "factor": 0.1})
print("################In real time################")
simulate(config={"rt": True})
```
Expected output (except the actual real time, as this depends on when you execute this example):
```
################As fast as possible################
Doing first task at time: 0
Doing second task at time: 0
Doing first task at time: 1
Doing second task at time: 2
Doing first task at time: 2
Doing first task at time: 3
################10 times faster than real time################
Doing first task at time: 1627372451.6871307
Doing second task at time: 1627372451.6871307
Doing first task at time: 1627372452.6871307
Doing second task at time: 1627372453.6871307
Doing first task at time: 1627372453.6871307
Doing first task at time: 1627372454.6871307
################In real time################
Doing first task at time: 1627372452.0911176
Doing second task at time: 1627372452.0911176
Doing first task at time: 1627372453.0911176
Doing second task at time: 1627372454.0911176
Doing first task at time: 1627372454.0911176
Doing first task at time: 1627372455.0911176
```
When simulating as-fast-as-possible, the environment time starts at 0. 
For real-time, you should be able to see that the time changes for the first and second case.
Besides, you should see relevant execution speed changes, with real-time being the slowest case-study.

As we just use the `simpy` package, we refer to their documentation for detailed information. 

## Structure of the repository

As the AgentLib needs to run on various devices, including one with limited storage capacity, we build the repository in a modular way.
- `agentlib\core` All core-features necessary to build own modules
- `agentlib\modules` All pre-defined modules. The installation of all such modules in optional. 
- `agentlib\models` All pre-defined models to simulate or optimize time-dependent systems. Again, installation is optional.
- `agentlib\utils` All utility functions such as validators, local testing etc.
