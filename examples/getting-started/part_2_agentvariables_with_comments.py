"""
This is part two of the tutorial.
Here, we will use AgentVariables to specify properties of the agent.

In this tutorial we learn about:
 - How to introduce state into an agent with AgentVariables
 - How to log AgentVariables and plot them over time

    # Answer:
    # You can certainly use normal variables, and class instance variables in modules.
    # In fact, it is often very appropriate to do so.
    #
    # AgentVariables are important, when the variable needs to be shared with other
    # modules or agents.
    # For example, here we use an AgentVariable, so that the
    # agentlogger module can see the value of our variable and keep track of it.
    # We will learn more on how that works later.
