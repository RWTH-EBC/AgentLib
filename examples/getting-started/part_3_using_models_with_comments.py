"""
This is part three of the tutorial.
Here, we will simulate a simple model.

In this tutorial we learn about:
 - how to use the simulator
 - how to write a simple model
 - how to use the local MAS utility to start your agents


The model will be about the change of a room temperature under a heat load.
The differential equation for the room temperature reads:
dT / dt = ((power - loss) / capacity)
The integration of this differential equation has to be defined in the model itself.
Here, we use a simple Euler-step for integration.

While we use a custom-written model in this example, there are other model types which
can be very useful and come with pre-implemented numeric routines. For example, the
FMU-model can simulate an FMU, and in the agentlib_mpc plugin, there is a CasADi-model,
 which handles the integration of ODEs for you.

We use the predefined simulator module. This can be a bit intimidating, as the
simulator has many configuration parameters, of which we may not know what they do
and which ones we will need. The source code of the simulator is found
at agentlib/modules/simulator.py.

    # play around with this example!
    # 1. Try changing the values of the parameters
    #     a) through the ModelConfig class
    #     b) in the agent config dict
    # 2. Try running the example in Realtime. Consider using the factor of the
    #    environment, to run in scaled real time
    # Bonus: Try adding an output to the model. The output could be something simple, like the room temperature, only
    # this time in kelvin instead of celsius.How would you do that? Can you plot it
    # as well?
